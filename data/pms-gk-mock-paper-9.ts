      { "id": "opt_201_4", "text": "Z", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "The letter 'J' is the only letter of the alphabet that does not appear in any element's name on the periodic table. For example, Xenon has 'X', Quasiparticle has 'Q' (not an element but used often in discussions, but even without it 'Q' appears in element symbols in some languages), and Zinc has 'Z'."

      { "id": "opt_202_4", "text": "Sperm Whale", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "While humans have a large brain, and elephants and sperm whales have the largest absolute brain sizes, the tree shrew has the largest brain-to-body mass ratio of any animal, at about 1:10. This is a common trick question as most people would assume a larger, more intelligent animal."

    ],
    "explanation": "Sudan, located south of Egypt, is home to the ancient Nubian kingdom of Kush, which built over 255 pyramids, far exceeding Egypt's approximately 120 known pyramids. These pyramids are generally smaller and steeper than their Egyptian counterparts."

    ],
    "explanation": "This is a trick question! Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is, ironically, the actual name for the fear of long words, often used as an example of a self-referential paradox in phobias. All the other options are also real phobias. This question tests your knowledge of common misconceptions about phobia names."

    ],
    "explanation": "Brazil holds the largest share of the world's freshwater resources, primarily due to the Amazon River basin, which carries about 20% of the world's fresh water. While Russia and Canada also have significant freshwater reserves, Brazil's share is the largest."

      { "id": "opt_207_4", "text": "Sugar", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are thousands of years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's unique chemical composition – low water content and high acidity – creates an environment where bacteria and microorganisms cannot thrive, making it virtually imperishable."

      { "id": "opt_208_4", "text": "Kazakhstan", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "While Switzerland and Austria are landlocked and have military forces, Hungary is the surprising answer. It operates a River Flotilla on the Danube River, which is considered a naval force, despite the country being landlocked from any ocean. Kazakhstan is also landlocked but is in Asia."

      { "id": "opt_209_4", "text": "San Marino", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "Lesotho is an independent country entirely surrounded by South Africa. While Vatican City and San Marino are also enclaves, they are both entirely surrounded by Italy. The question asks for \"the only country,\" implying a unique characteristic among the listed options or globally. Lesotho is often the trickier answer here as it's a larger, less commonly thought of enclave compared to the European microstates."

      { "id": "opt_210_4", "text": "Saturn", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "Most planets in our solar system rotate counter-clockwise on their axis (prograde rotation), but Venus rotates clockwise (retrograde rotation). Uranus also has an unusual tilt, making it appear to roll on its side, but Venus is the most direct answer for opposite rotation."

    ],
    "explanation": "Botanically, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, with seeds inside. Tomatoes fit this description perfectly. While avocado, pumpkin, and cucumber are also botanically fruits (specifically, pumpkin and cucumber are a type of berry called a \"pepo\"), the tomato is the most commonly mistaken for a vegetable in culinary contexts and is often the subject of this specific trick question."

    ],
    "explanation": "The Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in China is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world, stretching approximately 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles). The Yellow River is also in China but is shorter. The Ganges and Mekong are major rivers but not the longest in Asia."

      { "id": "opt_214_4", "text": "Baghdad", "isCorrect": false }
    ],
    "explanation": "The name \"Jerusalem\" is commonly interpreted to mean \"City of Peace\" or \"Foundation of Peace\" (from Hebrew 'Yireh' meaning \"to found\" and 'shalom' meaning \"peace\"). While Baghdad's historical name 'Madinat al-Salam' also means 'City of Peace', Jerusalem's current name has this etymology."

    ],
    "explanation": "This is a common trick question. While the Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert, the largest desert overall is the Antarctic Polar Desert. Deserts are defined by their aridity, not by heat. Antarctica receives very little precipitation and is therefore classified as a desert, covering an area of approximately 14 million square kilometers."
